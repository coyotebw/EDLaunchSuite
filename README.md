Launches the game, EDMC, Odyssey materials helper, SrvSurvey, and EDCoPilot in one go. Can right click > run with powershell, or use PSEBuilder by durgesh (https://github.com/durgesh0505/PSEBuilder) to make it into an exe. I've included an example exe and also the .ico I use.

**NOTE that this is configured with filepaths specifically for my machine, so the exe will probably not do anything for you. remember to adjust the filepaths as needed if using the powershell script
